$ rcodesign help parse-code-signing-requirement
Parse code signing requirement data into human readable text.

This command can be used to parse binary code signing requirement data and
print it in various formats.

The source input format is the binary code requirement serialization. This
is the format generated by Apple's `csreq` tool via `csreq -b`. The binary
data begins with header magic `0xfade0c00`.

The default output format is the Code Signing Requirement Language. But the
output format can be changed via the --format argument.

Our Code Signing Requirement Language output may differ from Apple's. For
example, `and` and `or` expressions always have their sub-expressions surrounded
by parentheses (e.g. `(a) and (b)` instead of `a and b`) and strings are always
quoted. The differences, however, should not matter to the parser or result
in a different binary serialization.
